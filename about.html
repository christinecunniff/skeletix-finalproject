					Founded in August 2014, Skeletix is the first ever overstock concert ticket vendor that uses the opaque pricing principal to give concertgoers the absolute lowest price on a ticket. This service will effectively liquidate a venue's unsold tickets as a means to bring consumers in to reinvigorate other crucial revenue streams- namely, the bar. Users begin their mobile app experience by selecting their desired geographic radius (.5-5 miles), their price ceiling (as low as $1), and one genre to eliminate (going to a show with Grandma? Stay out of the mosh pits and choose punk). After sending a "ticket request" to friends who also use the app, the user buys a ticket blindly - our algorithm finds a ticket that meets their specifications and due to opaque pricing, we are able to give them the absolute lowest price to start their night. Skeletix allows users to be decisively spontaneous and to roll the dice, taking them to new venues and exposing them to new bands all on a low budget, and since we are a marketplace for "day of show" extra tickets only, the venue doesn't take a loss. Everyone wins - more in the door means more at the bar, the main source of a venue's revenue.
